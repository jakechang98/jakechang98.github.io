Hi there! My name is Jake and I'm a Biomedical Informatics PhD student at Stanford University. I work with [Sylvia Plevritis](https://profiles.stanford.edu/sylvia-plevritis) on developing computational methods to better understand the spatial and temporal organization of the tumor microenvironment. 

I'm originally from Mililani, Hawai ªi and graduated from the University of Notre Dame in 2020 with Bachelor's degrees in Sociology and Statistics. During my undergraduate studies, I did computational psychology research with [Johnny Zhang](https://psychology.nd.edu/people/faculty/johnny-zhang/) at the [Lab for Big Data Methodology](https://bigdatalab.nd.edu/) and machine learning for satellite constellation design with the [Aerospace Corporation](https://aerospace.org/) and the [Institute for Pure and Applied Mathematics](https://www.ipam.ucla.edu/) at UCLA. After graduation, I spent two years as a data scientist at [84.51$^\circ$](https://www.8451.com/) and interned at [Genentech](https://www.gene.com/) before starting graduate school.

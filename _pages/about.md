My name is Jake and I'm a Biomedical Data Science PhD candidate at Stanford University. I work with [Sylvia Plevritis](https://plevritislab.stanford.edu/) on developing computational methods to better understand spatial and temporal cellular organization within the tumor microenvironment. I am particularly interested in Bayesian statistics, probabilistic machine learning, and single-cell/spatial multiomics.

<!-- I'm originally from Mililani, HawaiÊ»i and graduated from the University of Notre Dame in 2020 with Bachelor's degrees in Sociology and Statistics. During my undergraduate studies, I did computational psychology research with [Johnny Zhang](https://psychology.nd.edu/people/faculty/johnny-zhang/) at the [Lab for Big Data Methodology](https://bigdatalab.nd.edu/) and machine learning for satellite constellation design with the [Aerospace Corporation](https://aerospace.org/) and the [Institute for Pure and Applied Mathematics](https://www.ipam.ucla.edu/) at UCLA. After graduation, I spent two years as a data scientist at [84.51$^\circ$](https://www.8451.com/) and interned at [Genentech](https://www.gene.com/) before starting graduate school.  -->

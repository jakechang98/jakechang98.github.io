This is an aspirational component of my website. I'm hoping that the background research that I do as I scope out projects can be summarized here. I'm also hoping that to process of writing blog posts will be helpful to me to practice my both scientific writing and ability to articulate technical concepts. 

A few topics I am interested in at the moment: 
* Point processes 
* Copulas
* Dimensionality reduction and latent variable models (PCA, probabilistic PCA, factor analysis, CCA, ICA, etc.)
* Probabilistic graphical models
